# üïπÔ∏èüí∏ Recommendations for Electronic Products
Imagine that you're running an online shop that sells electronics. But its sales volume is relatively low and isn't increasing compared to the estimated sales of your competitors. What are you going to do?

That might be due to multiple reasons, poor marketing, for example. Another cause you noticed through your analysis is that users usually have just one or two electronic in their baskets when they place the order. Furthermore, users don't shop for electronics as frequently as other products like groceries and clothes. Therefore, you decided to increase their cart size in every order as much as possible. But how are you going to do it?

This repository contains a Python implementation of a recommender system that suggests products consumers are more likely to buy in their ongoing orders based on historical data of their previous purchases and feedback. 

## Problem statement
The average order value in the online shop is relatively low.

## Requirements
### From a business perspective
Utilize the historical user behavior data collected by the online shop to increase the average order value by X percent.
### From a User Experience perspective
Show personalized recommendations for every user on the landing page of the online shop based on the user's preferences. The quality of these recommendations might be assessed by an increase in the click-through rate by Y percent.
### From a technical perspective
Build a machine learning model that predicts the electronic products users will purchase in the future. The precision and recall of the model should be larger than some acceptable thresholds.
